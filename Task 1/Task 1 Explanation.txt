For this task, I implemented a structured approach using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure the page is interactive, visually appealing, and responsive.

1. User Input Handling
I created an input field for the user's name and a dropdown menu for selecting a favorite color. JavaScript retrieves these values when the user clicks the button. To ensure a smooth experience, I added validationâ€”if a user tries to submit without entering a name or selecting a color, an error animation highlights the missing input.

2. Generating and Styling the Greeting
Once valid inputs are provided, JavaScript constructs a greeting message that dynamically updates based on the time of day. The selected color is then applied to the greeting using a gradient effect for a more modern look. The text is also designed to have a smooth transition when it appears, enhancing the visual appeal.

3. Dark Mode Toggle
I implemented a dark mode toggle to improve accessibility. Clicking the toggle button switches the background and text colors, providing a seamless transition between light and dark themes. This is handled through CSS class switching, ensuring a smooth effect.

4. Enhancing User Experience with Animations
To make the page more engaging, I incorporated animations when the greeting appears. The text smoothly transitions into view, and additional subtle effects like button press animations and hover states enhance interactivity. If the user inputs incorrect data, a slight shake effect on the input field indicates an error.

5. Mobile Responsiveness
The layout is designed to be fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes using flexible styling and media queries. Font sizes and spacing adjust dynamically to ensure a comfortable viewing experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

Final Outcome
By structuring the JavaScript for modular functionality and leveraging CSS animations, I created an intuitive and visually appealing web page. The interaction is smooth, the theme adapts to user preferences, and the overall design ensures an enjoyable user experience.
